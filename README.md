## Overview

CellQuant was created for the O'Donnell Lab at the University of Pittsburgh to quantify plasma membrane and vacuolar fluorescence in yeast cells.  

## Features

* Two membrane detection algorithms for cases with low/high fluorescence at the cell membrane
* Supplemental visual output
* Applet to demonstrate the program at different application settings
* Applet to sort and graph results

## How to Run

### Without R Installation

The easiest way to run the CellQuant program is to download the zip file of the [latest release](https://github.com/sah129/CellQuant/releases/tag/v0.8-alpha). This comes with an R-portable so no previous installation of R is required.  [Google Chrome Portable](https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable) is used for rendering.
