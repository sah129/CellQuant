IMAGEJ:

For finding cutoff as an input param:

Analyze->set scale.  Click to remove scale

Analyze -> measure 


Idea for GUI:

Have them set cutoff and choose sample image.  Run the image for 4 or 5 different brightness levels, display all at once.  Let them pick which one looks best. 

Do this for DIC and GFP

For tutorial:

Increasing the brightness on the GFP algorithm means you're more likely to pick up something you should.  For the DIC algoritm, increasing the brightness means you're more likely to pick up something you shouldn't.  For this reason, for the GFP algorith, if both 8 and 16 look good to you, choose 16.  For DIC, if both 2 and 4 look good to you, choose 2.
